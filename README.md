Simple games for fun
Here I place my simple versions of 
common games such as fizz-buzz, hangman etc.
CONTENT:
1. Fizz-Buzz Game - simple logical game for attention.
   Several players playing, counting numbers from 1 to 100 with step 1.
   If number not divide whether 3 or 5 player must say number itself.
   If number divide only 3, not 5 player must say "Fizz".
   If number divide only 5,not 3 player must say "Buzz".
   If number divide 3 and 5 both, player must say "Fizz-Buzz".
   If player is wrong - he's out a game.
   Player stay alive to the end became WINNER.
   If winner not found at the end of numbers - there's no winners at all.
2. GuessWordGame - simple game about guessing the movie. Initially player have 10 points,
   so it means player have 10 attempts to guess the word, letter by letter.
   Movie's list contains in file, so game randomly choose one movie to guess it.
   After the player guessed word (or failed), the information about player's name,
   player's points and player's state (GUESSED or NOT GUESSED) is saved in log file,
   so one can explore history of attempts.
