Simple games for fun
Here I place my simple versions of 
common games such as fizz-buzz, hangman etc.
CONTENT:
1. Fizz-Buzz Game - simple logical game for attention.
   Several players playing, counting numbers from 1 to 100 with step 1.
   If number not divide whether 3 or 5 player must say number itself.
   If number divide only 3, not 5 player must say "Fizz".
   If number divide only 5,not 3 player must say "Buzz".
   If number divide 3 and 5 both, player must say "Fizz-Buzz".
   If player is wrong - he's out a game.
   Player stay alive to the end became WINNER.
   If winner not found at the end of numbers - there's no winners at all.
